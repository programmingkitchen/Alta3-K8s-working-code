# Create and Configure Pods

**Description**
You have already launched Pods, however, you have yet to actually write any Pod Manifests. 
These Pod manifests are what declaratively define all of the information necessary 
to launch a Pod. The kubectl command is used to create many different 
Kubernetes resource objects, not just Pods.
